"""This scripts loads and cleans the iML1515 SBML (Monk et al., 2017) as given in the BiGG database (Schellenberger et al., 2010) and saves it again with cobrapy.

This is done in order to gain a version which is not altered by cobrapy while loading it.
The "cleaning" contains steps such as setting 1000 flux bounds to inf.
